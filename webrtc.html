     === NOTA BENE ===
      For the three scripts below, if your spec resides on dev.w3 you can check them
      out in the same tree and use relative links so that they'll work offline.

      To tag a new releas in git hub

          Once the version is checked in and ready to go, you tag it with (need
          to chance the 20110823 to correct date )

               git tag -a v20120323 -m "This is release 20120323"

         Tags are not transferred by default with the push so you have to
         add a - -tags parameter to the push so it looks like. Note you need to
         remoce the space between the - and -tag to make a double dash. 

              git push - -tags 

         or alternatively you can push just the new tag with 

              git push origin v20120323


      To generate the dated version of the specification:

           Open this doc in Mozilla. 

           Do a CTRL-ALT-SHIFT-S

           Select "XHMTL( source)" from dialog box. This will pop a new tab with
           generated version of the document.

           This will open a new tab with generated html. Copy and paste this to
           a new file. Note if you use Chrome or Safari, this step will not
           work. What will happen is the paste will have the original document,
           not what was displayed in the window that you did the copy on.

           Rename the new file to the correct day such as
           webrtc-broken-20111003.html then search for and edit the links for
           "This version" and "Previos version". Add the new file into CVS and
           check in. 

           Once everyone is happy, the webrtc-broken.html and
           webrtc-broken-20111003.html files can be copied to
           webrtc.html and webrtc-20111003.html
           respectively in the ../editor/. directory.

      <h2>Network Stream API</h2>

      <section>
        <h3>Introduction</h3>

        <p>The <code>MediaStream</code> interface, as defined in the
        [[!GETUSERMEDIA]] specification, typically represents a stream of data
        of audio and/or video. A <code>MediaStream</code> may be extended to represent a
        stream that either comes from or is sent to a remote node (and not
        just the local camera, for instance). The extensions required to
        enable this capability on the <code>MediaStream</code> object will be
        described in this document.</p>

        <p>A <code>MediaStream</code> as defined in [[!GETUSERMEDIA]] may
        contain zero or more <code>MediaStreamTrack</code> objects. A
        <code>MediaStreamTrack</code> sent to another peer MUST appear as one
        and only one <code>MediaStreamTrack</code> to the recipient.
	[[OPEN ISSUE: This is a 2119 MUST, but how is it enforced?
	What needs to be described rather is a mapping from MSTs to
	SDP and then back.]]
	</p>

        <p>Channels are the smallest unit considered in the
        <code>MediaStream</code> specification. Channels are intended to be
        encoded together for transmission as, for instance, an RTP payload
        type. All of the channels that a codec needs to encode jointly MUST be
        in the same <code>MediaStreamTrack</code> and the codecs SHOULD be
        able to encode, or discard, all the channels in the track.</p>

        <p>The concepts of an input and output to a given
        <code>MediaStream</code> apply in the case of <code>MediaStream</code>
        objects transmitted over the network as well. A <code>
            <a>MediaStream</a>
          </code> created by a <code>
            <a>PeerConnection</a>
          </code> object (later described in this document) will take as input
        the data received from a remote peer. Similarly, a
        <code>MediaStream</code> from a local source, for instance a camera
        via [[!GETUSERMEDIA]] will have an output that represents what is
        transmitted to a remote peer if the object is used with a <code>
            <a>PeerConnection</a>
          </code> object.</p>

        <p>The concept of duplicating <code>MediaStream</code> objects as
        described in [[!GETUSERMEDIA]] is also applicable here. This feature
        can be used, for instance, in a video-conferencing scenario to display
        the local video from the userâ€™s camera and microphone in a local
        monitor, while only transmitting the audio to the remote peer (e.g. in
        response to the user using a "video mute" feature). Combining tracks
        from different <code>
            <a>MediaStream</a>
          </code> objects into a new <code>
            <a>MediaStream</a>
          </code> is useful in certain cases.</p>
      </section>

      <section>
        <h3>Interface definitions</h3>

        <p class="note">In this section, we only specify aspects of the the
        following objects that are relevant when used along with a
        <code>PeerConnection</code>. Please refer to the original definitions
        of the objects in the [[!GETUSERMEDIA]] document for general
        information on using <code>MediaStream</code> and
        <code>MediaStreamTrack</code> both in and outside the context of
        <code>PeerConnection</code>.</p>

        <section>
          <h4>MediaStream</h4>

          <section>
            <h4>label</h4>

            <p>The <code>label</code> attribute specified in
            <code>MediaStream</code> returns a label that is unique to this
            stream, so that streams can be recognized after they are sent
            through the <code>
                <a href="#peerconnection">PeerConnection</a>
              </code> API.</p>

            <p>When a <code>
                <a href="#mediastream">MediaStream</a>
              </code> is created to represent a stream obtained from a remote
            peer, the <code>label</code> attribute is initialized from
            information provided by the remote source.</p>

            <p class="note">The label of a <code>
                <a>MediaStream</a>
              </code> object is unique to the source of the stream, but that
            does not mean it is not possible to end up with duplicates. For
            example, a locally generated stream could be sent from one user to
            a remote peer using <code>
                <a>PeerConnection</a>
              </code>, and then sent back to the original user in the same
            manner, in which case the original user will have multiple streams
            with the same label (the locally-generated one and the one
            received from the remote peer).</p>
          </section>

          <section>
            <h4>Events on MediaStream</h4>

            <p>A new media component may be associated with an existing <code>
                <a>MediaStream</a>
              </code>. This happens, e.g., on the A-side when the B-side adds
            a new <code>
                <a>MediaStreamTrack</a>
              </code> object to one of the track lists of a <code>
                <a>MediaStream</a>
              </code> that is being sent over a <code>
                <a>PeerConnection</a>
              </code>. If this happens for the reason exemplified, or for any
            other reason than the <code>add()</code> [[!GETUSERMEDIA]] method
            being invoked locally on a <code>
                <a>MediaStreamTrackList</a>
              </code> or tracks are being added as the stream is created (i.e.
            the stream is initialized with tracks), the user agent MUST run
            the following steps:</p>

            <ol>
              <li>
                <p>Create a <code>
                    <a>MediaStreamTrack</a>
                  </code> object <var>track</var> to represent the new media
                component.</p>
              </li>

              <li>
                <p>If <var>trackâ€™s</var> <code>
                    <a href="#dom-mediastreamtrack-kind">kind</a>
                  </code> attribute equals "<code>audio</code>", add it to the
                <code>
                    <a>MediaStream</a>
                  </code> objectâ€™s <code>
                    <a href="#dom-mediastream-audiotracks">audioTracks</a>
                  </code> <code>
                    <a>MediaStreamTrackList</a>
                  </code> object. [[OPEN ISSUE: Is there a way to generalize this
		so that if we add a "smell" track this continues to work.]]</p>
              </li>

                <p>If <var>trackâ€™s</var> <code>
                    <a href="#dom-mediastreamtrack-kind">kind</a>
                  </code> attribute equals "<code>video</code>", add it to the
                <code>

                  </code> object.</p>
              </li>

              <li>
                <p><a>Fire a track event</a> named <code>
                    <a
                    href="#event-mediastreamtracklist-addtrack">addtrack</a>
                  </code> with the newly created <var>track</var> at the <code>
                    <a>MediaStreamTrackList</a>
                  </code> object.</p>
              </li>
            </ol>

            <p>An existing media component may also be disassociated from a
            <code>
                <a>MediaStream</a>
              </code>. If this happens for any other reason than the
            <code>remove()</code> [[!GETUSERMEDIA]] method being invoked
            locally on a <code>
                <a>MediaStreamTrackList</a>
              </code> or the stream is being destroyed, the user agent MUST
            run the following steps:</p>

            <ol>
              <li>
                <p>Let <var>track</var> be the <code>
                    <a>MediaStreamTrack</a>
                  </code> object representing the media component about to be
                removed.</p>
              </li>

                <p>Remove <var>track</var> from the <code>
                    <a>MediaStreamTrackList</a>
                  </code> object.</p>
              </li>

              <li>
                <p><a>Fire a track event</a> named <code>

            </ol>

          <p>A <code>MediaStreamTrack</code> objectâ€™s reference to its
          <code>MediaStream</code> in the non-local media source case (an RTP
          source, as is the case for a <code>MediaStream</code> received over
          a <code>PeerConnection</code>) is always strong.</p>

          <p>When a track belongs to a <code>
              <a>MediaStream</a>
            </code> that comes from a remote peer and the remote peer has
          permanently stopped sending data the <code>ended</code> event MUST
          be fired on the track, as specified in [[!GETUSERMEDIA]].
	  [[ OPEN ISSUE: How do you know when it has stopped? This seems like
	  an SDP question, not a media-levelquestion.]]</p>

          <p>A track in a <code>
              <a>MediaStream</a>
            </code>, received with a <code>

            </code> (1) until media data arrives.</p>

          <p>In addition, a <code>MediaStreamTrack</code> has its

        <p>The <code>

          </code> that only carries audio and is extended to have the
        capability to send and/or receive DTMF codes.</p>

      <h2>Peer-to-peer connections</h2>

      <p>A <code>
          <a>PeerConnection</a>
        </code> allows two users to communicate directly, browser to browser.
      Communications are coordinated via a signaling channel which is provided
      by unspecified means, but generally by a script in the page via the server,
      e.g. using <code>XMLHttpRequest</code>.</p>

      <p>Calling <code>new <a>PeerConnection</a>(<var>configuration</var>
      )</code> creates a <code>
          <a>PeerConnection</a>
        </code> object.</p>

      <p>The <var>configuration</var> has the information to find and access
      the [[!STUN]] and [[!TURN]] servers. There may be multiple servers of
      each type and any TURN server also acts as a STUN server. </p>

      <p>A PeerConnection object has an associated ICE Agent, PeerConnection
      state, and ICE State. These are initialized when the object is
      created.</p>

      <p>When the <dfn id="dom-peerconnection">
          <code>PeerConnection()</code>
        </dfn> constructor is invoked, the user agent MUST run the following
      steps. This algorithm has a synchronous section (which is triggered as
      part of the event loop algorithm).</p>

      <ol>
        <li>
          <p>Create an ICE Agent and let <var>connection</var>â€™s <a
          href="#peerconnection-ice-agent"><code>PeerConnection</code> ICE
          Agent</a> be that ICE Agent and provide it the STUN and TURN servers
          from the configuration array. The [[!ICE]] will proceed with
          gathering as soon as the IceTransports constraint is not set to
          "none". At this point the ICE Agent does not know how many 
	  ICE components it needs (and hence the number of candidates to
	  gather) but it can make a reasonable
          assumption and as the PeerConnection object gets more information,
          it can adjust the number of components. </p>
        </li>

        <li>
          <p>Set <var>connection</var>â€™s <a
          href="#peerconnection-readiness-state"><code>PeerConnection</code>
          readiness state</a> to <code>

        </li>

        <li>

          ice state </a> to <code>
              <a href="#widl-PeerConnection-NEW">"new"</a>

            </code> array. </p>
        </li>

        <li>
          <p>Let <var>connection</var>â€™s <code

              <a>MediaStream</a>
            </code> array. </p>
        </li>

        <li>
          <p>Return <var>connection</var>, but continue these steps
          asynchronously.</p>
        </li>

        <li>
          <p>Await a stable state. The synchronous section consists of the
          remaining steps of this algorithm. </p>
        </li>
      </ol>

      <p> During the lifetime of the PeerConnection object, the following
      procedures are followed: </p>

      <ol>
        <li>
          <p>If the ice state is set to "new" and the IceTransports constraint
          is not set to "none", it MUST queue a task to start gathering ICE
          address and set the ice state to "gathering".
          [[OPEN ISSUE: Can the state be "set" to "new". Isn't this rather,
	    ice state equals "new".]]
	  </p>
        </li>

        <li>
          <p> If the ICE Agent has found one or more candidate pairs for any
          MediaTrack that forms a valid connection, the ICE state is changed
          to "connected". </p>
        </li>

        <li>
          <p> When the ICE Agent finishes checking all candidate pairs, if at least
          one connection has been found for some MediaTrack, the iceState is
          changed to "completed" and if no connection has been found for any
          MediaTrack, the iceState is changed to "failed". 
	  [[OPEN ISSUE: Note that this means that if I was able to negotiate
	    audio but not video via ICE, then iceState == "completed". Is this
	    really what is desired?]]
	  </p>
        </li>

        <li>
          <p> If the iceState is "connected" or "completed" and both the local
          and remote session descriptions are set, the peerState is set to
          "active". </p>
        </li>

        <li>
          <p> If the iceState is "failed", a task is queued to calls the close
          method. Open Issue: CJ - this seems wrong to me.

        </li>
      </ol>

      <p>User agents negotiate the codec resolution, bitrate, and other media
      parameters. User agents are encouraged to initially negotiate for the
      maximum resolution of a video stream. For streams that are then rendered
      (using a <code>video</code> element), user agents are encouraged to
      renegotiate for a resolution that matches the rendered display size.</p>

      <p class="note">Starting with the native resolution means that if the
      Web application notifies its peer of the native resolution as it starts
      sending data, and the peer prepares its <code>video</code> element
      accordingly, there will be no need for a renegotiation once the stream
      is flowing.</p>

              capabilities supported by the session (as opposed to an answer,
              which will include only a specific negotiated subset to use);
              for each SDP line, the generation of the SDP must follow the
              appropriate process for generating an offer. In the event

              to the session since the last complete offer-answer exchange,
              such as addition or removal of streams. If no changes have been

              (e.g. a finite number of decoders), createOffer needs to return
              an offer that reflects the current state of the system, so that
              setLocalDescription will succeed when it attempts to acquire
              those resources. The session descriptions MUST remain usable by
              setLocalDescription without causing an error until at least end

              media plane should be established. The generation of the SDP
              must follow the appropriate process for generating an answer or

              <p> Session descriptions generated by createAnswer must be

      <p> IANA is requested to register the constraints defined in <a
      href="#sec-constraints"> Constraints Section </a> as specified in
      [[!RTCWEB-CONSTRAINTS]]. </p>

      <section>
        <h3 id="sec-constraints">Constraints</h3>

        <p> TOOD: Need to change the naming and declaration of these
        constraints to match the constraints draft once that is a bit further
        along. The names here now are likely not quite right but they serve as
        a place holder. 
	  [[OPEN ISSUE: there are multiple ways to add constraints. How are
	  multiple values reconciled?]]
	</p>

        <p> The following new constraints are defined that can be used with a
        PeerConnection object: </p>

        <dl>
          <dt> OfferToReceiveVideo </dt>

          <dd>
            <p> This is a enum type constraint that can take the values "true"
            and "false". The default is a non mandatory "true" if a
            PeerConnection has been added to the video stream and non-mandatory
            "false" otherwise.
	      [[OPEN ISSUE: I don't think this is coherent, because that means
	      that all PCs start with this set to false and then somehow
	      implicitly change if you do AddStream()]]
	    </p>

            <p> In some cases, a PeerConnection may wish to receive video but
            it is not going to send any video. The PeerConnection needs to
            know if it should signal to the remote side if it wishes to
            receive video or not. This constraints allows an application to
            indicate its preferences for receiving video when creating an
            offer. </p>
          </dd>

          <dt>OfferToReceiveAudio </dt>

          <dd>
            <p> This is a enum type constraint that can take the values "true"
            and "false". The default is a non mandatory "true". </p>

            <p> In some cases, a PeerConnection may wish to receive audio but
            it is not going to send any audio. The PeerConnection needs to
            know if it should signal to the remote side if it wishes to
            receive audio. This constraints allows an application to indicate
            its preferences for receiving audio when creating an offer. </p>
          </dd>

          <dt> VoiceActivityDetection </dt>

          <dd>
            <p> This is a enum type constraint that can take the values "true"
            and "false". The default is a non mandatory "true". </p>

            <p> Many codecs and system are capable of detecting "silence" and
            changing there behavior in this case by doing things such as not
            transmitting any media. In many cases, such as when dealing with
            sounds other than spoken voice or emergency calling, it is
            desirable to be able to turn off this behavior. This constraints
            allows the application to provide information about if it wishes
            this type of processing enable or disabled. </p>
          </dd>

          <dt> IceTransports </dt>

          <dd>
            <p> This is a enum type constraint that can take the values
            "none", "relay", and "all". The default is a non mandatory "all".
            </p>

            <p> This constraints indicates which candidates the ICE engine is
            restricted use. The value "none" means the ICE engine MUST not
            send or receive any packets at this point. The value "relay"
            indicates the ICE engine MUST only using media relay candidates
            such as candidates passing through a TURN server. This can be used
            to reduce leakage of IP addresses in certain use cases. The value
            of "all" indicates all values can be used. </p>

      <h3>Simple Example</h3>

      <div>
        <p>When two peers decide they are going to set up a connection to each
        other, they both go through these steps. The STUN/TURN server
        configuration describes a server they can use to get things like their
        public IP address or to set up NAT traversal. They also have to send
        data for the signaling channel to each other using the same
        out-of-band mechanism they used to establish that they were going to
        communicate in the first place.</p>

        <pre class="example sh_javascript"> var signalingChannel =
        createSignalingChannel(); var pc; // set up the call, get access to
        local media, and establish connectivity function start(isCaller) { //

        PeerConnection("", function (candidate) {
        signalingChannel.send(JSON.stringify({ "type": "candidate", "sdp":
        candidate })); }); // get the local stream and show it in the local
        video element navigator.getUserMedia({"audio": true, "video": true},
        function (stream) { selfView.src = URL.createObjectURL(stream);

        pc.createOffer(gotDescription); type = "offer"; } else {
        pc.createAnswer(pc.remoteDescription, gotDescription); type =
        "answer"; } function gotDescription(desc) {
        pc.setLocalDescription(type, desc);
        signalingChannel.send(JSON.stringify({ "type": type, "sdp": desc }));
        } }); // once remote stream arrives, show it in the remote video
        element pc.onaddstream = function (evt) { remoteView.src =

        function (evt) { var msg = JSON.parse(evt.data); var sdp =
        SessionDescription(msg.sdp) switch (msg.type) { case "offer": //

        <h3>DataChannel</h3>

        <p>The <code>
            <a>DataChannel</a>
          </code> interface represents a bi-directional data channel between
        two peers. A <code>
            <a>DataChannel</a>
          </code> is created via a factory method on a <code>
            <a>PeerConnection</a>
          </code> object. The corresponding <code>
            <a>DataChannel</a>
          </code> object is then dispatched at the other peer if the channel
        setup was successful.</p>

        <p>Each <code>
            <a>DataChannel</a>
          </code> has an associated <dfn>underlying data transport</dfn> that
        is used to transport actual data to the other peer. The transport
        properties of the <a>underlying data transport</a>, such as
        reliability mode, are configured by the peer taking the initiative to
        create the channel. The other peer cannot change any transport
        properties of a offered data channel. The actual wire protocol between
        the peers is out of the scope for this specification.
	  [[EDITORIAL: this needs to say clearly that the configuration state
	  is somehow passed between the peers.]]

	</p>

        <p>A <code>
            <a>DataChannel</a>
          </code> created with <code>
            <a
            href="#dom-peerconnection-createdatachannel">createDataChannel()</a>
          </code> MUST initially be in the <code>
            <a href="#widl-DataChannel-CONNECTING">CONNECTING</a>
          </code> (0) state. If the <code>
            <a>DataChannel</a>
          </code> objectâ€™s <a>underlying data transport</a> is successfully
        set up, the user agent MUST <a
        href="#announce-datachannel-open">announce the
        <code>DataChannel</code> as open</a>.</p>

        <p>When the user agent is to <dfn
        id="announce-datachannel-open">announce a <code>DataChannel</code> as
        open</dfn>, the user agent MUST queue a task to run the following
        steps:</p>

        <ol>
          <li>
            <p>If the associated <code>

          </li>

          <li>
            <p>Let <var>channel</var> be the <code>

              </code> at <var>channel</var>.</p>
          </li>
        </ol>

        <p>When an <a>underlying data transport</a> has been established, the
        user agent, of the peer that did not initiate the creation process
        MUST queue a task to run the following steps:</p>

              </code> (3), abort these steps.</p>
          </li>

          <li>
            <p>Let <var>configuration</var> be an information bundle with
            key-value pairs, received from the other peer as a part of the
            process to establish the <a>underlying data channel</a>.</p>
          </li>

          <li>
            <p>Let <var>channel</var> be a newly created <code>

        <li>Tweak the introduction text and add a reference to the IETF RTCWEB
        group.</li>

        <li>Changed the first argument to getUserMedia to be an object.</li>

        <li>Added a MediaStreamHints object as a second argument to
        PeerConnection.addStream.</li>

        <li>Added AudioMediaStreamTrack class and DTMF interface.</li>
      </ol>

      <h3> Changes since 23 August 2011</h3>

      <ol>
        <li> Separated the SDP and ICE Agent into separate agents and added
        explicit state attributes for each. </li>

        <li> Removed the send method from PeerConenction and associated
        callback function. </li>

        <li>Modified MediaStream() constructor to take a list of
        MediaStreamTrack objects instead of a MediaStream. Removed text about
        MediaStream parent and child relationship.</li>

        <li>Added abstract.</li>

        <li>Moved a few paragraphs from the MediaStreamTrack.label section to
        the MediaStream.label section (where they belong).</li>

        <li>Split MediaStream.tracks into MediaStream.audioTracks and
        MediaStream.videoTracks.</li>

        <li>Removed a sentence that implied that track access is limited to
        LocalMediaStream.</li>

        <li>Updated a few getUserMedia()-examples to use
        MediaStreamOptions.</li>

        example code.</li>

        <li>Fixed some broken getUserMedia() links.</li>

        <li>Introduced state handling on MediaStreamTrack (removed state
        handling from MediaStream).</li>

        <li>Reintroduced onended on MediaStream to simplify checking if all
        tracks are ended.</li>

        <li>Aligned the MediaStreamTrack ended event dispatching behavior with
        that of MediaStream.</li>

        <li>Updated the LocalMediaStream.stop() algorithm to implicitly use
        the end track algorithm.</li>

        <li>Replaced an occurrence the term finished track with ended track
        (to align with rest of spec).</li>

        <li>Moved (and extended) the explanation about track references and
        media sources from LocalMediaStream to MediaStreamTrack.</li>

        <li>Removed section "Obtaining local multimedia content".</li>

        <li>Updated getUserMedia() calls in examples (changes in Media Capture
        TF spec).</li>

        <li>Introduced MediaStreamTrackList interface with support for adding
        and removing tracks.</li>

        <li>Updated the algorithm that is run when PeerConnection receives a
